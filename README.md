# PrivacyPolicy
The Android Play Store Privacy Policy

This application:
- does not use analytics (neither google nor other)
- does not use ads (neither google nor other)
- does not use any cookies
and does not collect any data - regardless the version of the application.

This application has 2 versions: 
- 1xxxx (aka the old one) (e.g.: 1040128 tageting old phones, like api 11 and above)
- 2xxxx (aka the new one) (e.g.: 2065011 for new phones, api 24 and above)

Being an open source application (based on FBReader), it uses other 3rd party applications.
To protect further from any unknown issues/mistakes, in the new version we have also cut all permissions.
This way, the new version (2xxxxx) of the application:
- does not use (nor request) any network connection
- does not use (nor request) sdcard access (neither write nor read) (we have limited to sand-boxed directory for storing the books).

Should anyone identify any problem related to privacy, is kindly asked to contact us immediately at aplicatii.romanesti@gmail.com .
